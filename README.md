JS-Snake is a browser based, Snake style game scripted in pure JavaScript.

It features an inbuilt mod page, accessed by pressing the "M" key, while not selecting any input, which allows you to mod the player's speed. The number of the speed is time in milliseconds between each move (the default being 80). This means the lower the number, the faster the player moves.
